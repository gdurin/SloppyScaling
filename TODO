TODO list



* 
Version 10:
Order and names of variables changed from "k,L,Win" to "L,k,W"
Function getLabels rewritten to take care of all the possible labels (also with rescaled variables)
Labels are ordered using Utils.get_independent otherwise plots use ordering of the keys (L, k, W)

Plot of the residuals
Introduced SST and R_square (not yet valid)

Before version 10:
* Change .bin to .bnd as a file extention (Done)
* Axes scale control for point, not for lines (Done)
* Create JoinModule.py to replace AwkAhkModule and set variables to load the propert modules (Done)


BUGS TO FIX
* rowstoSkip skip the first rows ONLY in the fits
* Data filenames are not unique: some have "k=0001", others "k0001"; partially fixed in each module
* Calculation of SST and R_square
* Use of Xsname in SloppyScaling
